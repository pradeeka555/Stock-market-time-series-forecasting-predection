## 📝 Introduction

Forecasting stock prices is a crucial task in financial analysis and quantitative trading. This project utilizes time series modeling methods to analyze historical stock market data and predict future price movements. The main component is the Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates data preprocessing, model selection, and prediction steps for effective stock market forecasting.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares stock market datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes trends, seasonality, and patterns in stock prices.
- **Modeling Techniques:** Implements popular time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- **Prediction:** Forecasts future stock prices and evaluates model performance.
- **Interactive Notebook:** Step-by-step code in the included Jupyter Notebook (`Time_Series_Stock_Prediction.ipynb`).
